# J2Player

J2Player is a javascript music player, based on [http://jplayer.org](JPlayer). It adds playlists and a basic theme for playing music to a mobile device.

It currently supports HTML5 enabled devices with flash support on the way.

## Examples

index.html pulls a track list from my blog [http://j2labs.tumblr.com](j2labs.tumblr.com). It then queries last.fm for album artwork.

j2d2.html is an example with a hard coded playlist of some bands I played in over the years. *I know, I know... So shameless!*
